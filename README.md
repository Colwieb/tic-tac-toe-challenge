# Tic Tac Toe Challenge

This repository starts a tic-tac-toe matchmaking server and dashboard, which you can connect to using the template client in the client-template folder.

The goal is to allow students to compete with each other in writing a tic-tac-toe AI, and ranking the various clients against eachother using the ELO ranking algorithm (best known for its usage in chess)
